# GeoQuiz
### Description

GeoQuiz is a simple android app that displays a series of geographical True/False questions. Using true or false buttons, a toast will appear to indicate whether the user answered correctly.

This is my first Android App. This app uses Android Studio. Within this app, I am exploring fundementals of android projects, layouts, and explicit intents. 

I am following lessons from "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" 2nd edition by Bill Phillips, Chris Stewart, Brian Hardy and Kristin Marsicano.
