### About Me

This is my first android app . I have used Android Studio to create this app. Within the app,I try to explore fundementals of android projects, layouts, and explicit intents. 

I am following lessons from "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" 2nd edition by Bill Phillips, Chris Stewart, Brian Hardy and Kristin Marsicano.
