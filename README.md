# GeoQuiz
### Description

GeoQuiz is a simple android app that displays a series of geographical True/False questions. A toast will indicate whether the user has answered correctly. A cheating feature is also implemented in case the user wants to cheat to get the answer. 

+This is my first android app. I have used A2ndroid Studio to create this app. Within the app, I explore fundementals of android projects, layouts, and explicit intents. 

I am following lessons from "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" 2nd edition by Bill Phillips, Chris Stewart, Brian Hardy and Kristin Marsicano.
